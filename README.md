# Intermittent Tailwind Class Application Issue
This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied after the build process. The issue seems to be intermittent, meaning it doesn't occur every time the project is built.

## Bug Description
Certain Tailwind CSS classes, such as background colors and padding, sometimes fail to apply to elements after the build process completes.  The issue is not related to syntax errors or incorrect class names; it appears to be a build process or caching problem. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Open the output file (index.html) in a browser.
5. Observe that the text in the div may or may not have the specified styles.

## Solution
The solution involves clearing the cache and rebuilding. The specifics of how to achieve this depends on the tooling and build process used, but often include steps such as deleting build artifacts, clearing browser cache, and even running a full clean install. The bugSolution.js file demonstrates a robust solution.
